1
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:04,100
Here we go

2
00:00:04,101 --> 00:00:06,817
It's its its the life i choose

3
00:00:06,818 --> 00:00:09,935
gunshots in the dark,
    one eye closed

4
00:00:9,936 --> 00:00:12,686
And we got it cooking like 
     a one- eyed stove

5
00:00:12,687 --> 00:00:15,356
You can catch me kissing my girl
      with both eyes closed

6
00:00:15,357 --> 00:00:17,562
Perfecting my passion,
    thanks for asking

6
00:00:17,564 --> 00:00:20,801
Couldn't slow down so
   we had to crash it

7
00:00:20,802 --> 00:00:23,256
You used plastic, we 'bout cash

8
00:00:23,257 --> 00:00:26,993
I see some people ahead that we gon' pass
                          YEAH!!!

9
00:00:26,996 --> 00:00:30,096
I never feared death or dying

10
00:00:30,097 --> 00:00:32,216
I only fear never trying

11
00:00:32,217 --> 00:00:34,096
I am whatever I am 

12
00:00:34,101 --> 00:00:37,083
Only God can judge me , now

13
00:00:37,089 --> 00:00:40,562
One shot, everything rides on

14
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:43,322
    Tonight even if I 've got

15
00:00:43,324 --> 00:00:46,574
  Three strikes I'mma go for it

16
00:00:46,576 --> 00:00:48,589
This moment , we own it

17
00:00:48,593 --> 00:00:51,104
And I' m not to be played with

18
00:00:51,109 --> 00:00:53,981
Because it can get dangerous

19
00:00:53,985 --> 00:00:57,123

20
00:00:57,129 --> 00:00:59,981
This moment , we own it

00:00:59,983 --> 00:01:01,505
<i>And the same ones that I ride with</i>

22
00:01:01,508 --> 00:01:03,076
<i>be the same ones that I die with</i>

23
00:01:03,081 --> 00:01:04,663
<i>put it all out on the line with</i>

24
00:01:04,667 --> 00:01:06,106
<i>if you looking for me you can find Wiz</i>

25
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:07,584

<i>working hard ,reppin for my dogs ,do this everyday</i>

31

stuck to the plan

32
00:01:18,367 --> 00:01:21,462
always think that we would 
     stand up, never ran

33
00:01:21,467 --> 00:01:23,893

    never change up

Jumpin out on anybody who
        try to say some

never turn our backs, our cars
    dont even lose control

42
00:01:38,965 --> 00:01:41,760
